# My Inventory app
Saint Leo University Course Project - COM-437

# Background
Inventory management can be a daunting task for anyone. Keeping track of what food you have in your pantry or cleaning supplies can be exhausting. It is tough to remember what items you need to put on a shopping list.

# Purpose
My Inventory is a mobile application that can help manage with the issues above. Whether you are keeping track of refrigerated items, nonperishables in the pantry or other household supplies, My Inventory will allow you to keep track of what you are running low on. With a click of a button, you can add them to a Shopping List for future use. Each Shopping List will act as a to-do list so you never forget an item.
